[Try out the substituter!](sa-link)

A lambda-calculus based interpreter for the [Source
language](https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/source/), a sublanguage of JavaScript,
written in TypeScript.

This interpreter steps through and records each reduction step of the program.
It can be used for the first 2 chapters of the source language ([Source
ยง1](https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/source/source_1/), [Source
ยง2](https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/source/source_2/)) as state changes are not
allowed in these languages. Idempotency of pure functions ensures the
lambda-calculus based reduction rules evaluate the program correctly.

I plan to write an article that explains the workings of this interpreter soon.

### Some little scripts

#### [IVLE Downloader (Deprecated)](https://github.com/SwampertX/ivle-downloader)

[![Github][view-on-gh-badge]](https://github.com/SwampertX/ivle-downloader)

A downloader I forked to automate the downloading of files from IVLE, my
university's learning management system.

IVLE has been replaced by [LumiNUS](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg) since Aug 2019.
For a LumiNUS downloader, please check out
