*A great start to a great future!*


**Hello**, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! 

I will be posting my writings soon, be it on programming, app development or music, hopefully this contributes to the open source community by sharing my knowledge with the world.

For now, check out the [About Me](/pages/about/) for a brief introduction of myself. My resume is also included there!

Feel free to contact me!
