### Resume please?

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MKIJBWTu0g9YguMM1H_qWGAZF8e0dpV2/view?usp=sharing) you go! :)

### Who are you?

![](/tanah_lot.jpg)
I am Yee Jian, a second year student in [National University of Singapore](www.nus.edu.sg).
Brave enough, I am studying a Double Degree in **Computer Science and Mathematics**.
Challenging problems are the doses of adrenaline rush I can **never** get enough.

You can check out the projects I have done [here](projects).

I will be graduating in May 2023. Currently actively looking for any software engineering or research internship opportunities. If you think I might be a good fit, feel free to **contact me at [yeejian.tan@u.nus.edu](mailto:yeejian.tan@u.nus.edu)**!

### What are you interested in?

I am stil exploring the vast number of fields Computer Science has to offer, but currently I intend to focus on Algorithms and Distributed Systems for my degree. Modules I have taken include **CS3244 Machine Learning** and **DYM1401CS Type Theory**.

I also try to contribute to open source projects such as the [USC Website](https://github.com/usdevs/usc-website).
Recently, I made my [first contribution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/20662) to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)! I am planning to write an article documenting it soon.

### What are you interested in outside school?

I love playing the Piano! I play as a soloist, accompanist, and an ensemble musician. In my repertoire, I have Chopin Etudes, the Yellow River Piano Concerto, and Ginastera's Danzas Argentinas.

I have also clinched multiple awards at the national level, including **Champion** at the **VIVACE Naional Piano Ensemble Competition in Singapore, in 2017**.

I was previously the the person-in-charge of [USClassical](https://nususc.com/group/hhrBz6p3Hl0DuTcUFiAC), an interest group in [USP](https://usp.nus.edu.sg) which gathers around and perform classical music a few times a year.

Currently, I serve as the principal player for [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) II in the
[NUS Chinese Orchestra](https://www.nuschineseorchestra.com)!

### Anything to showcase?

Of course! Check out the projects on the side bar. Many are only minimally viable, and work in progress, but I really love them! (Philosophy: I won't write a software that I won't use)
